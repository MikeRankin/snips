# snips
Some basic snippets for html, jquery, coldfusion and bootstrap

Feel free to add anything you think is missing.

## installation
Clone the repository into your Sublime Text 3 Packages folder and restart.  The snippets should then be active.

For me (on OS X) my snippets directory is located at 
/Users/*username*/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User/.  The checkout should add a folder called snips there.
